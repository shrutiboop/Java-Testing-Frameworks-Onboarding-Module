To make it easier here's a table that describes some key differences between each of these frameworks.

The decision is based on your preferences as well as the particular requirements of your project. Conventional unit testing may be successfully completed with JUnit, which has a sizable community and ecosystem. Projects needing complex configuration and concurrent test execution are a good fit for TestNG or JUnit. If you enjoy a more creative and readable syntax, Spock is a great choice, especially if you're familiar with Groovy. When it comes to mocking, Mockito is the preferred option, particularly when paired with other testing frameworks.

Depending on your testing requirements, combining these frameworks may be the best course of action in many situations. For instance, employing Mockito or Spock for behavior verification and mocking, and JUnit or TestNG for test structure and execution.
